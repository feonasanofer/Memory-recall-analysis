This project analyzes memory recall patterns using eye-tracking data. The goal is to distinguish between true and false memory recall events based on eye movement behavior, such as fixation count and saccade length. The analysis is supported by data visualizations and machine learning models to classify recall types.

Eye-tracking dataset 

Sample Insights:
Participants with false memory recall showed longer fixation durations and fewer saccades.

KNN and Decision Tree classifiers showed good accuracy in distinguishing recall types.
